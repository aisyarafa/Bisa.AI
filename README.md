# Bisa.AI Data Science Bootcamp - Final Project

Welcome to my final project repository from the Bisa.AI Data Science Bootcamp (Batch 33). In this project, I predict annual health insurance costs using a dataset of insurance holders' information.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Objective
The goal of this project is to predict health insurance costs per year using machine learning, specifically linear regression. The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

### Dataset
- **Source:** `insurance.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `age`: Age of the individual
  - `sex`: Gender of the individual
  - `bmi`: Body Mass Index
  - `children`: Number of children covered by health insurance
  - `smoker`: Smoking status
  - `region`: Residential area
  - `charges`: Annual medical charges (target variable)

### Key Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Model Building and Training**
6. **Model Evaluation**
7. **Conclusion and Insights**

## 📚 What I Learned
- Data manipulation and cleaning using Pandas
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Building and evaluating machine learning models with Scikit-learn
- Feature engineering and handling missing values
- Model evaluation techniques and metrics

- `insurance.csv`: Dataset used for the project
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## 📈 Results and Insights
A linear regression model was used, but it wasn't ideal for this dataset as only 2 out of 5 assumptions were met. However, it still successfully predicted health insurance costs with an acceptable level of accuracy. Key insights include the significant impact of smoking status on insurance costs and the correlation between BMI and medical expenses.
